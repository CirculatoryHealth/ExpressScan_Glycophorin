### Abstract.
**Introduction**<br/>
The accumulation of erythrocyte membranes within an atherosclerotic plaque may contribute to the deposition of free cholesterol and thereby the enlargement of the necrotic core. Erythrocyte membranes can be visualized and quantified in the plaque by immunostaining for the erythrocyte marker glycophorin C. We therefore hypothesized, that glycophorin C is a marker for plaque vulnerability and may therefore reflect intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), vulnerability of plaques and predict pre-procedural neurological symptoms.

**Methods**<br/>
We quantified glycophorin C in human atherosclerotic plaque samples from 1,819 consecutive asymptomatic and symptomatic patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy from the Athero-Express Biobank with the slideToolKit. 

**Results**<br/>
The prevalence of IPH was 62.4%, and the prevalence of pre-procedural neurological symptoms was 87.1%. The percentage glycophorin staining was significantly higher in male patients compared to female patients (median 7.15 (IQR:3.37, 13.41) versus median 4.06 (IQR:1.98, 8.32), p<0.001). Quantified glycophorin C was associated with IPH (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.63, 2.21; p=<0.001) when corrected for clinical confounders. Glycophorin C was significantly associated with ipsilateral pre-procedural neurological symptoms (OR:1.27, 95%CI:1.06-1.41, p=0.005), and upon sex-stratified analyses, specifically in male patients (OR 1.37; 95%CI 1.12, 1.69; p=0.003), but not in female patients (OR 1.15; 95%CI 0.77, 1.73; p=0.27). Glycophorin was associated with classical features of a vulnerable plaque, such as a larger lipid core (OR 1.85; 95%CI 1.60, 2.15; p<0.001), a higher macrophage burden (OR 1.87; 95%CI 1.63, 2.14; p<0.001), less calcifications (OR 0.81; 95%CI 0.71, 0.91; p<0.001), a lower collagen and SMC content (OR 0.70; 95%CI 0.60, 0.82; p<0.001 and OR 0.60; 95%CI 0.52, 0.68; p<0.001, respectively). There were marked sex differences, in male patients glycophorin was associated with calcifications and collagen (OR 0.75; 95%CI 0.64, 0.87; p<0.001 and OR 0.65; 95%CI 0.53, 0.79; p<0.001, respectively) while these associations were not found in female patients.

**Conclusion**<br/>
Quantified glycophorin C was independently associated with the presence of IPH, symptomatic preprocedural symptoms in male, and with a more vulnerable plaque composition in both women and men. Which strengthens the hypothesize that plaque glycophorin C is a marker of plaque vulnerability.
